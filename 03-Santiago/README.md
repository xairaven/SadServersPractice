# "Santiago": Find the secret combination

**Link:** [*scenario/santiago*](https://sadservers.com/scenario/santiago)

**Level:** Easy

**Type:** Do

**Description:** Alice the spy has hidden a secret number combination, find it using these instructions:
1) Find the number of lines with occurrences of the string Alice (case sensitive) in the `*.txt` files in the `/home/admin` directory
2) There's a file where Alice appears exactly once. In that file, in the line after that "Alice" occurrence there's a number.
Write both numbers consecutively as one (no new line or spaces) to the solution file. For example if the first number from 1) is 11 and the second 22, you can do `echo -n 11 > /home/admin/solution; echo 22 >> /home/admin/solution` or `echo "1122" > /home/admin/solution`.

**Test:** Running `md5sum /home/admin/solution` returns `d80e026d18a57b56bddf1d99a8a491f9` (just a way to verify the solution without giving it away.)

**Time to Solve:** 15 minutes.

**Best Time:** 9 mins 35 secs.
